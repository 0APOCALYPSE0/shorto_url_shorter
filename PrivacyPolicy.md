# Shorto URL Shortener Extension Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to the Privacy Policy of the Shorto URL Shortener Extension ("Shorto"). We are dedicated to protecting your privacy, and we want to assure you that your personal information is not accessible when you use our extension. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data.

### Information You Provide

When you use the Shorto extension to shorten URLs, we collect and store the original long URL and the corresponding shortened link. It's important to emphasize that we do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) during this process. Your privacy is our top priority, and we do not track or store data that can be used to identify you personally.

### Usage Data

To continually improve our extension and enhance your experience, we collect anonymous usage data. This includes information such as the number of links shortened, the date and time of access, the device and browser you use, and the country from which you access our service. This data is aggregated and analyzed to gain insights into user behavior and preferences, allowing us to make informed enhancements to our extension. Importantly, this data does not include any information that can identify individual users.

### Cookies

Shorto may use cookies to improve your user experience. Cookies are small text files stored on your device that help us recognize you and remember your preferences. You have the option to disable cookies in your browser settings, but please be aware that doing so may impact the functionality of the extension.


### Service Improvement

We use the collected usage data to analyze trends, identify areas for improvement, and optimize our extension's performance. This information helps us understand how users interact with Shorto and enables us to provide a better service. Rest assured that this data is always analyzed in the aggregate and does not identify individual users.

### Data Protection

We take data protection seriously. Your shortened URLs are stored securely on our servers, and we do not share them with third parties. We adhere to strict data retention policies and automatically delete shortened URLs after a specified period, which is typically 90 days. This ensures that your data remains protected and is not retained longer than necessary.
